Object Oriented Programming aims to implement real world entities 
like Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation in programming. 

The main aim is to bind together the data and the functions 
so that other parts of the code cannot access them.

# **Polymorphism**

The word polymorphism means having many forms. In simple words, 
we can define polymorphism as the ability of a message to be 
displayed in more than one form.
 
**Real Life Example:** A Person at the same time can have different 
characteristics. A man can be a father, a brother, a son, a friend 
in different situations.

Polymorphism is the ability of OOPs programming languages to differentiate
between entities of the same name. Its done in Java with the help of 
signature and declaration of the entities 

Polymorphism is of 2 types:  
1. Overloading 
1. OverridingÂ
